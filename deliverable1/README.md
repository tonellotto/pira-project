# Distributed Personal Information Recognition system using gRPC

This deliverable aims at:

1. identifing, classifing and linking information relating personal data of sensitive nature (proper names, city names, identification codes, geographical coordinates) in textual documents;
2. effectively and efficiently anonymizing the identified personal data, according to their nature, keeping the statistical value of the data unchanged.

To achieve this goal, the technologies used are:
1. [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/), for data identification and Anonymization,
2. [Google gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc), an open source universal RPC framework,
3. [Docker](http://docker.com), for deployment and execution on different Cloud platforms.

## Getting started

The deliverable constist of two folders, one for the analyzer and one for the anonymizer. In each folder you find the `proto` folder which contains a file called `model.proto` used to generate the needed stubs to create the gRPC client/server (`model_pb2.py` and `model_pb2_grpc.py`), the `analyzer-temp`/`anonymizer-temp` folder used by the server to save temporary files and four python files. 

For example in the case of the anonymizer: 
1. `anonymizer_server.py` - to implement the gRPC server
2. `anonymizer_client.py` - to implement the gRPC client
3. `data_loader.py` - a python program to use the functionality of the anonymizer (setup a configuration, perform anonymization/deanonymization)
4. `clientGUI.py` - a test graphical user interface

The `analyzer-results`/`anonymizer-results` folder is used to collect the corresponding results generated by the Presidio modules.

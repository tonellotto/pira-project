# Distributed Personal Information Recognition system using gRPC

This deliverable aims at:

1. identify, classify and link information relating personal data of sensitive nature (proper names, city names, identification codes, geographical coordinates) in textual documents;
2. effectively and efficiently anonymize the identified personal data, according to their nature, keeping the statistical value of the data unchanged.

To achieve this goal, the technologies used are:
1. [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/) for data identification and Anonymization,
2. [Google gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc), an open source universal RPC framework.

## Getting started

The project constist of two folders, one for the analyzer and one for the anonymizer. In each folder you find the `proto` folder which contains a file called `model.proto` used to generate the needed stubs to create the gRPC client/server (`model_pb2.py` and `model_pb2_grpc.py`), the `analyzer-temp`/`anonymizer-temp` folder used by the server to save temporary files and four python files. For example in the case of the anonymizer: 
1. anonymizer_server.py - used to implement the gRPC server
2. anonymizer_client.py - used to implement the gRPC client
3. data_loader.py - a python program to use the functionality of the anonymizer (setup a configuration, perform anonymization/deanonymization)
4. clientGUI.py - a graphical user interface

The `analyzer-results` folder and the `anonymizer-results` folder are used to contain the respective results generated by the Microsoft Presidio modules.
